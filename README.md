# boundednumbers
A small Python library providing numeric types with automatic boundary enforcement. Includes clamped, cyclic, bouncing, and modular integer types, as well as unit-interval floating-point types that auto-correct out-of-range values. Useful for math utilities, simulations, game development, and any system where numbers must stay within defined bounds
